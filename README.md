# COE328
This repository contains the zip files of some of the labs I did in this course (Digital Systems).
There were too many files to upload, and so I thought it would be more convenient if I just created zip folders for each of them.

All of these labs were done in Altera Quartus II (or Intel Quartus Prime) and coded in VHDL.
These labs incorporate the uses of finite state machines, logic gates, seven segments displays, decod, encod and multiplexers.
